"""Mycroft Skill that handles requests on a private NextCloud calendar.

This Skill is activated via Mycroft by one of the key sentences in meeting.my.next.intent.
Settings can be changed via Mycroft profile. The settings are defined in settingsmeta.yaml.
They include neccessary login information for NextCloud.

  Typical usage example:

  Q: "Hey Mycroft, when is my next appointment?"
  A: "Your next appointment is on June 22th at 12:30 and is entitled Speech Interaction Class"
